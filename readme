# 🎙️ VoiceBot – Personal AI Assistant

This is a VoiceBot powered by a Language Model (LLM) that can understand your voice, talk back to you, and is designed with data and prompts about me (Aswin). You can interact with it using your voice — like a real conversation!

---

## 🧠 Features

- 🎤 Voice Input (Speech-to-Text)
- 💬 AI-Powered Responses (LLM via OpenAI API or similar)
- 🗣️ Bot Replies using Text-to-Speech (TTS)
- 🧠 Prompt-engineered with custom data about Aswin
- 🌐 Simple HTML/JS Frontend (No Streamlit)
- 🔁 Full voice-to-voice interaction loop

---

## 🚀 How It Works

1. **Frontend**: A basic HTML + JavaScript page is used to:
   - Record audio via the browser
   - Send it to the backend for speech-to-text (STT)
   - Display and forward the transcription to the chatbot
   - Convert the bot's response to speech (TTS) and play it back

2. **Backend (FastAPI)**:
   - `/stt/`: Accepts audio, converts to text using SpeechRecognition
   - `/chat/`: Accepts text, returns LLM response
   - `/tts/`: Accepts text, returns voice via `gTTS` and plays audio

## 🛠️ Running Locally

1. **Clone the repo**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/voicebot.git
   cd voicebot


Install dependencies:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the FastAPI server:

bash
Copy
Edit
uvicorn main:app --reload
Open the frontend:

Open index.html from the static/ folder directly in your browser OR

If served via FastAPI static mount, access it at: http://localhost:8000

🌍 Deployed Version
The app is deployed on Render:

👉 https://voicebot-aswin.onrender.com

Upload or record voice

Get bot replies and hear the voice response

🧪 Development Notes
Make sure microphone access is enabled in the browser.

Audio must be recorded in WAV format to be compatible with the backend STT.

This version drops Streamlit and uses native JS + HTML for better control and compatibility with deployment platforms like Render.
